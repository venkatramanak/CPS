# Implementing ISV licensing for Dynamics365

This article covers the details about how ISV's can build their Apps in App Source with Licensing Feature enabled so that they would be able to help their customers to renew their App license and resume the app functioning without any issues.

Consider a scenario where ISV's building a Dynamics365 Apps and decided to give it for Trial Version for a certain period time and later convert that into paid app in a quick way.
A potential customer discovers your application in AppSource, signs in and agree to the terms of use. App should start notifying the customers when licensing period of the App is going to end and enable customers to renew the license before the app is getting expired or getting into unusable mode.
